# Time-use Imputation for Modelling Emissions (TIME)

This project explores how we can leverage Dutch register data to impute survey data for individuals outside the original sample.

In the context of climate sociology, we use household expenditure and individual time-use data as example surveys. The resulting predictions can be combined to estimate individual and household carbon emissions at the population level.



This repository is currently under development.



## Workflow

1. Integrate and preprocess register datasets (e.g., CBS microdata)
2. Prepare and clean survey datasets (e.g., time-use or expenditure surveys)
3. Train and evaluate baseline & machine learning models to predict missing or linked data
4. Generate population-level predictions



### Integrate Register Data

### Prepare Survey Data

### Train & Test Models

### Predict at the Population Level
